Welcome to my repo for practice files from my intro to programming in C++ and UNIX! These projects were created to hone my programming skills and serve as examples of simple C++ algorithms including data structures, arrays, and dynamic memory allocation. This is simply used as a practice ground to get familiar with github and implement proper coding techniques such as coding indentation, meaningful comments, low coupling and high cohesion.
